### Content
In the past week, l had being lost and confuse about Kaboom, but l watched one [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4slFm0lows) that it really help me understand more about Kaboom. In the video it example the different between Kaboom and Phaser 3, to make me understand how Kaboom work. I was trying a game that a little bean is collecting coin. 
``` js

onKeyPress("space", () => {
	if (player.isGrounded()) {
		player.jump()
	}
})
```

This is a code that to make user jump when they click on space 

``` js
onKeyDown("left", () => {
	player.move(-SPEED, 0)
})

onKeyDown("right", () => {
	player.move(SPEED, 0)
})
```
And this two code make player move left and right when they press on the left and right arrow which created half of the game.



### Engineering Design Process
Right now l was the stage 5(Create a prototype) of Engineering Design Process because now l was building the basic of my game using Kaboom, at this stage l am creating the basic movement that player can do.




### Skills 
The first skill was Collaboration because the classmate sitting next to me was using the same tool as me which are Kaboom, he showed me his game and l was asking help when my code was bugging and l couldn't figure it out, So Collaboration helped me a lot. The next skill was Creativity because when you were creating a game, you gotta be creative so yout game not gonna look boring.



### Professionalism
At the end l just wanted to say that don't be afraid from asking question and asking your partner for help, because it really gonna help you learn and be less afraid from talking if you keep doing it.

### Engineering Desigh Process
l will say l am in Test and evaluate the prototype because right l am testing code in my IDE for Kaboom and trying to learn the job for every code.


### Skills 
The first skill l use was Debugging this skill help you to fix your code, for example that before l can't add any character to my Kaboom mini game but after debugging it was solve. The second skill was How to read that this skill help l understand more stuff about something for example in Kaboom website there tutoring and code that you can read to help you learn more.



### Professionalism 
Lastly always have a look on your code because it might have a bug and than you could use debugging skill to make your code correct in the way you want.
